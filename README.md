# SmartGardeningSystem
SmartGardenOS is the open source operating system of my project,
I'm working on this project since November 2020.
It is a smart and economic watering system, so it waters the plantations with the right amount of water (depending of the humidity of the soil) and takes back the water that flewed down of the terrain.
This device takes a lot of measurements like the soil temperature and moisture, the air hygrometry value and the air temperature.
All those datas are displayed on the screen on top of the box but you can import it in live in Excel to make graphs or whatever.
If you want to open the PDF file in this repo, you have to download it.
# For DIY fans:
If you want to make your smart gardening system, please read the following informations:
- The 3D files are located in the ZIP files named "MeteoStation STL" and "Boitier"
- The hardware that I used are wroten in the file named "listeComposants.txt"
- If you are looking for a good 3D printer, I recommend the Wanhao Duplicator 12/230. It is a good and affordable 3d printer.
- I printed the plastic parts in PLA, but you can use your favorite material (except conductors like metal if you have a professionnal printer or a CNC machine ;-)  )

If you have any question or idea about this project, please e-mail me at hugo.quintart@athenee-ath.be
